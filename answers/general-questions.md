## Availabiliy:

1. In Septembre if possible, but I can also start earlier if needed.
2. Depending on the salary I could go for 4 months.
3. The perfect plan would be for you to be satisfied enough with my work to hire me on the spot. The next best plan would be to consider me for a work study program. And in the worst case, it would be looking for a company willing to hire me with the experience I gained from the internship.

## Personal projects:

- A project I am proud of is Argent Bank, a project I worked on as part of my training. The objectives were to create a React web application from static files, connect to the MongoDB database, setup authentication, and manage global stats. <br> <br>
- Steps: Integrating the web application with the different routes, setting up the store, reducers, and API services, working on authentication and related components, and managing the username features.<br> <br>
- Technologies: Vite to setup a quick React environment, react-router-dom for the routes, and Redux Toolkit for state management since it simplies Redux and makes it easier to write. <br> <br>
- The main difficulty was the state management. It was my first time using Redux Toolkit. Besides reading the documents, I watched several tutorials, used Stackoverflow, and other sources I could find online to solve my issues. <br> <br>
- Besides the fundamentals of Redux Toolkit, what I really learned was to make use of documentation and search for needed information. <br> <br>

  ## Other questions:

  1. I would say beginner. The reason is while I worked on a few projects and learned the fundamentals, the more I research, the more I realize there is more to learn. From the best practices to more efficient ways to code, I still need practices to consider myself at an intermediate level.
  2. To keep up to date, I use daily.dev to get diversified information about different technologies, follow Kevin Powell, Traversy Media , JavaScript Mastery, and others on YouTube, and am suscribed to newsletters. There is also linkedin where I follow people that share often about new technologies.
  3. I am only familiar with Windows.
